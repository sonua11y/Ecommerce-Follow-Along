# Milestone 7: Backend User Login Endpoint with Password Validation üîê

## Overview üìå
This milestone focuses on building a **secure login endpoint** for user authentication. The process includes **validating user credentials** and securely comparing the provided password with the **encrypted password** stored in the database. 

The implementation follows industry standards for **privacy** and **data protection**, ensuring a reliable and robust login system.

---

## Features üöÄ
### 1. **User Login Endpoint**
   - Accepts **email/username** and **password** as inputs.
   - Validates user existence and authenticates credentials.

### 2. **Password Encryption & Comparison**
   - Utilized **bcrypt** for password hashing and comparison.
   - Ensured user passwords are protected even if the database is compromised.

### 3. **Secure Authentication Process**
   - Step-by-step approach:
     1. Fetch user data based on the provided email/username.
     2. If the user does not exist, return an error: *"User does not exist."*
     3. Hash the entered password using bcrypt and compare it with the stored hash.
     4. If the hashes match, the user is successfully authenticated; otherwise, return an error.

---

## Why Password Encryption Matters üîí
### 1. **Protects User Data**:
   - Prevents the exposure of plain-text passwords in case of a data breach.
### 2. **Complies with Security Standards**:
   - Adheres to regulations like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
### 3. **Enhances Security**:
   - Hashed passwords are **one-way encrypted**, making it challenging to reverse-engineer them.

---

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **Node.js/Express**: For creating the backend API.
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing and secure comparison.
- **Database (e.g., MongoDB)**: For user record storage.

---

## Getting Started üèÅ
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Test the endpoint using tools like **Postman**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /login`
   - Payload:
     ```json
     {
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "password": "password123"
     }
     ```

### Implementation Details
1. **Mongoose Schema Creation**
   - Defined a schema using Mongoose.
   - Added field-level validation.
   - Created a model to interact with MongoDB.

2. **API Endpoint Development**
   - Built a POST endpoint (`/api/products`) to handle product data submission.

Learning Outcomes

Created an API endpoint to extract and send product data from MongoDB.

Implemented a function on the frontend to fetch the product data.

Dynamically displayed the product data using a reusable product card component.

Implementation Steps

Backend:

Developed an API endpoint that retrieves all product data from MongoDB.

Ensured data is formatted and sent as a JSON response.

Frontend:

Created a function to fetch product data from the backend.

Passed the received data to the product card component for dynamic rendering.

Integrated the product listing into the home page.


Submission:

Code has been pushed to the GitHub repository.

The repository is publicly accessible.

This README file summarizes the progress for Milestone 11.


## Milestone 12:

In this milestone, I implemented the "My Products" page, which allows users to view all products associated with their email. The following key features were developed:

API Endpoint Creation: Developed an endpoint that retrieves products from MongoDB based on the user's email. This endpoint queries the products collection and returns the relevant data to the frontend.

Data Fetching: Implemented a function on the frontend to fetch the product data from the newly created API endpoint. This function handles the API call and updates the state with the retrieved products.

Dynamic Display: Utilized the existing product card component to dynamically render the list of products on the "My Products" page. Each product is displayed using a card format, enhancing the user interface and experience.

This milestone successfully enhances the application by providing users with a personalized view of their added products.
