# E-Commerce Application using MERN Stack

## Description
As part of this project, I am building a comprehensive E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This hands-on experience will help me explore real-world development practices, equipping me with the skills to create scalable and secure web applications.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

### Learning Goals 
By the end of this milestone, I:
- Understood the overall structure of a MERN project.
- Learned the foundational steps for setting up a new project.
- Gained clarity on the functionalities of an e-commerce application.
- Prepared for upcoming milestones by setting up the project repository.

### Key Features of the Project
1. **Technology Stack**: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
2. **REST API Creation**: I learned how to build scalable APIs to handle various tasks like user authentication, product management, and order handling.
3. **Authentication**: I explored how to implement secure login and registration functionalities.
4. **Database Schema Design**: I started understanding how to design structured data models using MongoDB.
5. **Backend Development**: I worked on setting up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.
6. **Frontend Development**: Using my knowledge of React.js, I will build a user-friendly interface.

### Core Concepts Covered
#### Overview of the MERN Stack
The MERN stack is a JavaScript-based technology stack, making it an ideal choice for building full-stack web applications. Its unified language across the stack simplifies development, making it accessible even for beginners like me.

#### REST API Structure and Endpoints
A REST API enables communication between the client and the server. In this project, I will create endpoints for:
- **User Authentication**: Registering and logging in users.
- **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
- **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

#### Basics of Database Schema Design
I learned about defining the structure and relationships of the data stored in MongoDB.

#### Role of Authentication in Web Applications
Authentication verifies user identity before granting access to specific resources. In this project, I will ensure users authenticate to make purchases or access sensitive information.

## Milestone 2: Setting Up the Project
### Learning Goals
By the end of this milestone, I:
- Set up a new MERN project from scratch.
- Configured the project structure.
- Installed necessary dependencies.
- Set up MongoDB for data storage.
- Implemented user authentication.
- Created REST API endpoints for user registration and login.
- Ensured secure password hashing and salting.
- Implemented user session management.
- Set up a basic React.js frontend.
- Integrated the frontend with the backend API.
- Ensured proper error handling and logging.

## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend
### Achievements
- Set up the foundational backend architecture using Express.js and Node.js.
- Configured environmental variables for secure configuration management.
- Connected the backend to a MongoDB database using Mongoose for data modeling.
- Implemented essential middleware for logging, request parsing, and error handling.
- Validated backend setup through initial test API routes.

## Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller
### Achievements
- Designed and implemented the **User** model using Mongoose, defining fields such as `name`, `email`, `password`, and `avatar`.
- Created controllers for handling user-related actions like registration and login.
- Incorporated validation logic for secure user input handling.
- Implemented password encryption using bcrypt for secure storage of user credentials.
- Added a basic controller structure for extensibility in future milestones.

## Milestone 5: Creating the Signup Page
### Achievements
- Built a responsive and user-friendly signup page using React and Tailwind CSS.
- Integrated file input functionality for users to upload profile pictures (avatar).
- Implemented a password toggle feature for enhanced usability.
- Established seamless communication between the frontend and backend for user registration using Axios.
- Handled form data securely using FormData and ensured compatibility with backend endpoints.
- Displayed success and error messages based on API responses to improve user feedback.
