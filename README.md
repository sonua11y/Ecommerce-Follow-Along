This milestone focuses on building a **secure login endpoint** for user authentication. The process includes **validating user credentials** and securely comparing the provided password with the **encrypted password** stored in the database. 

The implementation follows industry standards for **privacy** and **data protection**, ensuring a reliable and robust login system.

---

## Features üöÄ
### 1. **User Login Endpoint**
   - Accepts **email/username** and **password** as inputs.
   - Validates user existence and authenticates credentials.

### 2. **Password Encryption & Comparison**
   - Utilized **bcrypt** for password hashing and comparison.
   - Ensured user passwords are protected even if the database is compromised.

### 3. **Secure Authentication Process**
   - Step-by-step approach:
     1. Fetch user data based on the provided email/username.
     2. If the user does not exist, return an error: *"User does not exist."*
     3. Hash the entered password using bcrypt and compare it with the stored hash.
     4. If the hashes match, the user is successfully authenticated; otherwise, return an error.

---

## Why Password Encryption Matters üîí
### 1. **Protects User Data**:
   - Prevents the exposure of plain-text passwords in case of a data breach.
### 2. **Complies with Security Standards**:
