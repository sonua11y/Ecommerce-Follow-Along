# Milestone 7: Backend User Login Endpoint with Password Validation üîê

## Overview üìå
This milestone focuses on building a **secure login endpoint** for user authentication. The process includes **validating user credentials** and securely comparing the provided password with the **encrypted password** stored in the database. 

The implementation follows industry standards for **privacy** and **data protection**, ensuring a reliable and robust login system.

---

## Features üöÄ
### 1. **User Login Endpoint**
   - Accepts **email/username** and **password** as inputs.
   - Validates user existence and authenticates credentials.

### 2. **Password Encryption & Comparison**
   - Utilized **bcrypt** for password hashing and comparison.
   - Ensured user passwords are protected even if the database is compromised.

### 3. **Secure Authentication Process**
   - Step-by-step approach:
     1. Fetch user data based on the provided email/username.
     2. If the user does not exist, return an error: *"User does not exist."*
     3. Hash the entered password using bcrypt and compare it with the stored hash.
     4. If the hashes match, the user is successfully authenticated; otherwise, return an error.

---

## Why Password Encryption Matters üîí
### 1. **Protects User Data**:
   - Prevents the exposure of plain-text passwords in case of a data breach.
### 2. **Complies with Security Standards**:
   - Adheres to regulations like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
### 3. **Enhances Security**:
   - Hashed passwords are **one-way encrypted**, making it challenging to reverse-engineer them.

---

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **Node.js/Express**: For creating the backend API.
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing and secure comparison.
- **Database (e.g., MongoDB)**: For user record storage.

## Getting Started üèÅ
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Test the endpoint using tools like **Postman**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /login`
   - Payload:
     ```json
     {
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "password": "password123"
     }
     ```

   - Prevent storing plain-text passwords in the database.  

2. **User Data Management**:  
   - Store user details such as name, email, and encrypted passwords securely.  
   - Ensure the database structure supports both scalability and security.  

### Benefits of Encrypting Passwords
- **Protect User Data**: Safeguards passwords in case of data breaches.  
- **Enhance Privacy**: Prevents passwords from being visible to unauthorized individuals.  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adheres to security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.  
- **Mitigate Password Theft**: Makes it significantly harder for attackers to compromise accounts.

### Steps for Implementation  
Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll implement this in the live coding session:

1. **Encrypt Passwords**:  
   - Leverage `bcrypt` to generate a hash from the user‚Äôs password.
