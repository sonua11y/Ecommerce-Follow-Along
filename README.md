# Milestone 7: Backend User Login Endpoint with Password Validation 🔐

## Overview 📌
This milestone focuses on building a **secure login endpoint** for user authentication. The process includes **validating user credentials** and securely comparing the provided password with the **encrypted password** stored in the database. 

The implementation follows industry standards for **privacy** and **data protection**, ensuring a reliable and robust login system.

---

## Features 🚀
### 1. **User Login Endpoint**
   - Accepts **email/username** and **password** as inputs.
   - Validates user existence and authenticates credentials.

### 2. **Password Encryption & Comparison**
   - Utilized **bcrypt** for password hashing and comparison.
   - Ensured user passwords are protected even if the database is compromised.

### 3. **Secure Authentication Process**
   - Step-by-step approach:
     1. Fetch user data based on the provided email/username.
     2. If the user does not exist, return an error: *"User does not exist."*
     3. Hash the entered password using bcrypt and compare it with the stored hash.
     4. If the hashes match, the user is successfully authenticated; otherwise, return an error.

---

## Why Password Encryption Matters 🔒
### 1. **Protects User Data**:
   - Prevents the exposure of plain-text passwords in case of a data breach.
### 2. **Complies with Security Standards**:
   - Adheres to regulations like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
### 3. **Enhances Security**:
   - Hashed passwords are **one-way encrypted**, making it challenging to reverse-engineer them.

---

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Node.js/Express**: For creating the backend API.
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing and secure comparison.
- **Database (e.g., MongoDB)**: For user record storage.

## Getting Started 🏁
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Test the endpoint using tools like **Postman**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /login`
   - Payload:
     ```json
     {
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "password": "password123"
     }
     ```

# Milestone 8: Product Card Component & Homepage Layout 🎨✨

## Overview 📌
In this milestone, we developed a **frontend card component** for products and designed a structured **homepage layout** to display these cards. This project demonstrates the principles of reusability, organized design, and dynamic rendering to enhance user experience in web applications.

---

## Features 🚀
### 1. **Reusable Card Component**
   - Showcases product details such as **name**, **image**, and **price**.
   - Flexible design with props for dynamic content.
   - Streamlined layout to maintain visual consistency.

### 2. **Dynamic Data Rendering**
   - Utilized **array mapping** to iterate over product lists and render multiple cards.
   - Passed unique product data (name, price, image) dynamically to each card.

### 3. **Responsive Homepage Design**
   - Created a neat **grid layout** or **flexbox** to display cards effectively.
   - Ensured a visually appealing and user-friendly product showcase.

---

## How It Works 🔧

   - Utilize `bcrypt` to hash passwords during signup.  
   - Prevent storing plain-text passwords in the database.  

2. **User Data Management**:  
   - Store user details such as name, email, and encrypted passwords securely.  
   - Ensure the database structure supports both scalability and security.  

### Benefits of Encrypting Passwords
- **Protect User Data**: Safeguards passwords in case of data breaches.  
- **Enhance Privacy**: Prevents passwords from being visible to unauthorized individuals.  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adheres to security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.  
- **Mitigate Password Theft**: Makes it significantly harder for attackers to compromise accounts.

### Steps for Implementation  
Here’s how we’ll implement this in the live coding session:

1. **Encrypt Passwords**:  
   - Leverage `bcrypt` to generate a hash from the user’s password.  
   - Store the hashed password instead of raw text in the database for added security.  

2. **Database Integration**:  
   - Design a schema to save all necessary user information, including encrypted passwords, efficiently.  
   - Validate inputs to prevent unauthorized or malicious data entry.  

This milestone empowers the application to store user data safely and securely, forming a strong foundation for reliable user authentication and privacy compliance.
